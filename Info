Vehicle License Plate Scanner

Overview

This project detects and recognizes vehicle license plates from an image using OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract OCR for character recognition. The script processes the image, extracts the license plate region, and retrieves the alphanumeric text using OCR.

Features

Automatic license plate detection using contour approximation.

Image preprocessing with grayscale conversion, edge detection, and thresholding.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract to extract plate numbers.

Visual output with the detected plate highlighted and the extracted text displayed.

Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

Pytesseract (Tesseract-OCR)

Install Dependencies

pip install opencv-python pytesseract

Install Tesseract-OCR

Download and install Tesseract-OCR from: Tesseract Download

Set the Tesseract path in your script:

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

Usage

Place the image (photo.jpeg) of the vehicle containing the license plate in the project folder.

Run the script:

python license_plate_scanner.py

The detected license plate will be displayed along with the extracted text.

Code Breakdown

Load the image

Convert to grayscale

Apply edge detection (Canny)

Find contours and filter potential plates

Extract and preprocess the license plate region

Perform OCR to extract text

Display the detected plate and text

Possible Improvements

Improve OCR accuracy with adaptive thresholding and noise reduction.

Use deep learning models (YOLO, SSD) for better plate detection.

Extend functionality for video streams and real-time processing.
